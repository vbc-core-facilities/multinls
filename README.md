# Multiple nonlinear regression example

Demonstration of how to fit the same nonlinear function to several groups of data,
and how to compare the result to a "pooled fit". 

This example was developed to answer a data analysis question by Stela Jelenic
from the Saha group at IMBA.

## Prerequisites

The R packages `reshape2` and `ggplot2` must be installed.

## How to use

Run the script `multinls_example.R` and study its output carefully.
The script creates a plot in `plots/fits.png` with the observations and the fitted curves.
The technical details are explained in the comments in the script.
